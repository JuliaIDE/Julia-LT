# Julia-LT

[![Gitter chat](https://badges.gitter.im/one-more-minute/Julia-LT.png)](https://gitter.im/one-more-minute/Julia-LT) - feel free to ask questions here.

This is a Julia language plugin for Light Table, based on the [Jewel.jl](https://github.com/one-more-minute/Jewel.jl) editor backend. This plugin provides basic language support, but you should try [Juno](https://github.com/one-more-minute/Juno-LT) if you don't mind a different set of defaults from Light Table proper.

Please also see the [Juno wiki](https://github.com/one-more-minute/Juno-LT/wiki) for documentation and installation instructions (just install the "Julia" plugin instead of the "Juno" one).
